# Search API's
The following search services are available as part of the SDK bundled by default –
## Auto Suggest
The Autosuggest API helps users to complete queries faster by adding intelligent search capabilities to your web or mobile app. This API returns a list of results as well as suggested queries as the user types in the search field.
#### Java
~~~java
MapmyIndiaAutoSuggest.builder()  
        .query(searchText)  
        .build()  
        .enqueueCall(new Callback<AutoSuggestAtlasResponse>() {  
            @Override  
            public void onResponse(@NonNull Call<AutoSuggestAtlasResponse> call, @NonNull Response<AutoSuggestAtlasResponse> response) {  
                //handle response   
            }  
  
            @Override  
            public void onFailure(@NonNull Call<AutoSuggestAtlasResponse> call, @NonNull Throwable t) {  
                t.printStackTrace();  
            }  
        });

### Request Parameters
#### Mandatory Parameter
 1. ``query(String)`` : e.g. Shoes, Coffee, Versace, Gucci, H&M, Adidas, Starbucks, B130 {POI, House Number, keyword, tag}.
#### Optional Parameters
 1.  ``setLocation(latitude, longitude)``: e.g. setLocation(28.454,77.435).
 2. `zoom (double)` : takes the zoom level of the current scope of the map (min: 4, max: 18).
3. ``tokenizeAddress(boolean)``: provides the different address attributes in a structured object.
4. `pod`  (string) = it takes in the place type code which helps in restricting the results to certain chosen type.**Below mentioned are the codes for the pod**
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_SUB_LOCALITY
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_LOCALITY
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_CITY
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_VILLAGE
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_SUB_DISTRICT
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_DISTRICT
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_STATE
    -   AutoSuggestCriteria.POD_SUB_SUB_LOCALITY
5.  `filter`(string)  = This parameter helps you restrict the result either by mentioning a bounded area or to certain eloc (6 digit code to any poi, locality, city, etc.) below mentioned are the various types:
    -   `filter`  = bounds: lat1, lng1; lat2, lng2 (latitude, longitude) {e.g. filter("bounds: 28.598882, 77.212407; 28.467375, 77.353513")
    -   `filter`  = cop: {eloc} (string) {e.g. filter("cop:YMCZ0J")
6. `hyperlocal`(Boolean): This parameter lets the search give results that are hyper-localized to the reference location passed in the location parameter. This means that nearby results are given a higher ranking than results far from the reference location. Highly prominent results will still appear in the search results, however they will be lower in the list of results. This parameter will work ONLY in conjunction with the location parameter.

##  Place Details
MapmyIndia Place Details is a simple, standardized and precise pan-India digital address system. Every location has been assigned a unique digital address or an eLoc. The eLoc API can be used to extract the details of a place with the help of its eLoc i.e. a 6 digit code or a place_id.
#### Java
~~~java
MapmyIndiaPlaceDetail.builder()  
        .eLoc("mmi000")

            @Override  
            public void onResponse(Call<PlaceDetailResponse> call, Response<PlaceDetailResponse> response) {  
                //handle response   
            }  
  
            @Override  
            public void onFailure(Call<PlaceDetailResponse> call, Throwable t) {
