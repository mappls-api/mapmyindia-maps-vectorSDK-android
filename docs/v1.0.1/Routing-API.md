# Routes & Navigation API
## Routing API
Routing and displaying driving directions on map, including instructions for navigation, distance to destination, traffic etc. are few of the most important parts of developing a map based application. This REST API calculates driving routes between specified locations including via points based on route type(fastest or shortest), includes delays for traffic congestion , and is capable of handling additional route parameters like: type of roads to avoid, travelling vehicle type etc.
#### Java
~~~java
MapmyIndiaDirections.builder()  
        .origin(startPointLocal)  
        .steps(true)  
        .resource(DirectionsCriteria.RESOURCE_ROUTE_ETA)  
        .profile(DirectionsCriteria.PROFILE_DRIVING)  
        .overview(DirectionsCriteria.OVERVIEW_FULL)  
        .destination(endPointLocal)
        .build()  
        .enqueueCall(new Callback<DirectionsResponse>() {  
            @Override  
            public void onResponse(Call<DirectionsResponse> call, Response<DirectionsResponse> response) {  
                //handle response   
	    }  
  
            @Override  
            public void onFailure(Call<DirectionsResponse> call, Throwable t) {  
                 t.printStackTrace();  
	    }  
        });

## Driving Distance Matrix API
Adding driving directions API would help to add predicted travel time & duration from a given origin point to a number of points. The Driving Distance Matrix API provides driving distance and estimated time to go from a start point to multiple destination points, based on recommended routes from MapmyIndia Maps and traffic flow conditions
Get driving time and distance between a center point and up to 10 destination points using MapmyIndia Maps [Distance API](http://www.mapmyindia.com/api/v3/docs/distance-api).
